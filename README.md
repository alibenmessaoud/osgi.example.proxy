osgi.example.proxy
==================

This project is a little example how to implement proxies in OSGi. The proxy will be only set before a class if 
an interface has a special annotation. Same goes for the invoked methods. They must have annotations to be 
executed by the proxy. All other will run normal.

Current version has some "features" and it's not finished yet. I will write an artical on my blog. This one will 
be written in german, but if anyone has the wish to have it in english do not hesistate to write me.

Version number: 0.0.1a
